<p> Alcatraz is an amazing place! It's one of the most toughest prisons to escape in the 
world. It's a maximun security prison for the worst of the worst and the hardest of the hardest 
prisoners in the world. It's 1.4 miles from shore and the water ranges from 44-55 degrees Fahrenheit.
However inmates say that its actually a good prison. The cells only had one person in them 
which lowers the risk of violence. The guards were also respectful to the prisoners and 
they were respectful to the guard as well. The food was also better than the federal 
prisons too. There was also one escape that took months of planning and was maybe 
successful but it's not confirmed of a failed or success escape. The prison has also been 
featured in many games and movies and is a national landmark that I hope to visit someday. </p>
